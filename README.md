# Tutorial: Understanding Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) for Recommendation Systems
This tutorial is part of our Deep Learning Algorithms Tutorial Series and focuses on Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) â€” a fundamental component in recommendation systems. RBMs are powerful generative neural networks that excel at capturing complex patterns within user-item interaction data, enabling personalized recommendations for users.

# Overview
Tutorial Complexity: Advanced

Programming Language: Python

Library: TensorFlow

Experience Level: Intermediate to Advanced

Estimated Time: 1-2 hours

# Features
Hands-On Implementation: Learn by doing! Build an RBM from scratch using Python and TensorFlow, gaining a deep understanding of its core components and functionality.

Synthetic User-Item Interaction Matrix: Create a synthetic user-item interaction matrix that simulates user behavior. This matrix forms the basis for training and evaluating the RBM.

Contrastive Divergence Algorithm: Dive into the Contrastive Divergence algorithm, a critical technique for training RBMs. Explore the positive and negative phases involved in weight and bias adjustments.

Recommendation Generation: Explore how trained RBMs generate recommendations based on user preferences and hidden unit activations, harnessing patterns within the data.

Interactive GUI Example: In addition to code implementation, experience an interactive GUI example demonstrating the RBM-based recommendation process. Input your preferences and receive personalized recommendations.
